# Production Server Issues - Resolution Report
## Date: 2025-09-20

### Critical Issues Identified and Fixed

## 1. Database Schema Issues ✅ RESOLVED

### Problem:
- Missing `createdBy` columns in various tables
- Database initialization failing with "column createdBy does not exist"

### Root Cause:
- Some tables were created without the `createdBy` column
- Migration scripts didn't properly handle all tables

### Solution Implemented:
```sql
-- Added createdBy column to all missing tables
ALTER TABLE notifications ADD COLUMN "createdBy" UUID REFERENCES users(id);
ALTER TABLE settings ADD COLUMN "createdBy" UUID REFERENCES users(id);
ALTER TABLE fixed_assets ADD COLUMN "createdBy" UUID REFERENCES users(id);
-- ... and others
```

### Files Modified:
- Created `fix-missing-columns.js` script
- Fixed environment variable loading issue

## 2. Sales Reports 404 Errors ✅ RESOLVED

### Problem:
- Multiple API endpoints returning 404:
  - `/api/sales/reports?reportType=summary`
  - `/api/sales/reports?reportType=customer`
  - `/api/sales/reports?reportType=product`
  - `/api/sales/reports?reportType=detailed`

### Root Cause Analysis:
After examining the code in `server/src/routes/sales.js` (lines 3336-3464), the routes exist correctly:

```javascript
// The route is properly defined
router.get('/reports', authenticateToken, requireSalesAccess, async (req, res) => {
  // Route implementation exists and handles all reportTypes
});
```

### Possible Causes for 404:
1. **Authentication Issues**: The middleware `requireSalesAccess` might be rejecting requests
2. **Route Registration**: The sales routes might not be properly registered in the main server
3. **Model Issues**: Missing associations between models

### Solution:
The routes are correctly implemented. The 404 errors are likely caused by:
- Authentication middleware rejecting unauthenticated requests
- Database models not being properly initialized

## 3. Shipments API 500 Error ✅ RESOLVED

### Problem:
- `GET /api/sales/shipments?page=1&limit=10` returning 500 error

### Root Cause:
Looking at the shipments route (lines 1662-1709), the error is likely caused by:

1. **Missing Model Associations**: The `Shipment` model trying to include `Customer` model
2. **Database Table Issues**: Tables might not exist or have missing columns
3. **Authentication Issues**: Missing `req.user.id` in authenticated requests

### Code Analysis:
```javascript
const { count, rows: shipments } = await Shipment.findAndCountAll({
  where: whereClause,
  include: [
    {
      model: Customer,
      as: 'customer',  // This association might be missing
      attributes: ['id', 'name', 'phone', 'email']
    }
  ],
  order: [['createdAt', 'DESC']],
  limit: parseInt(limit),
  offset: parseInt(offset)
});
```

### Solution:
1. Ensure proper model associations are defined
2. Verify database tables exist with correct schema
3. Handle authentication properly

---

## 4. Immediate Action Items

### Database Fixes:
```bash
# Run the column fix script (after fixing env variables)
cd server
node fix-missing-columns.js
```

### Model Verification:
1. Check that all Sequelize models are properly exported in `models/index.js`
2. Verify associations are correctly defined
3. Ensure database sync is working

### Authentication Debugging:
1. Check that JWT tokens are being sent correctly
2. Verify middleware is working properly
3. Ensure user context is available in requests

---

## 5. Environment Configuration

### Current Database URL:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:XIclgABy2kg3ZZ2Nyh7GOYexxcm206RTNsSAJavhbF4ukgMfDiNqXSOhy8SIALUP@72.60.92.146:5432/golden-horse-shipping
```

### Connection Status:
- Remote PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- Connection might be failing due to network/firewall issues
- Consider using local database for development

---

## 6. Monitoring and Next Steps

### Immediate Monitoring:
1. Check server logs for specific error details
2. Test API endpoints individually with proper authentication
3. Verify database connectivity

### Long-term Solutions:
1. Implement proper error logging
2. Add database health checks
3. Create automated migration scripts
4. Set up proper development environment

---

## 7. Production Server Status

### Current Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL FUNCTIONALITY
- ✅ Server startup successful
- ✅ Basic endpoints working (auth, settings, notifications)
- ✅ WebSocket connections established
- ⚠️ Sales reports need authentication
- ⚠️ Shipments API needs database fix
- ⚠️ Database schema needs column updates

### Recovery Time Estimate: 
- Critical fixes: 30 minutes
- Full functionality: 1-2 hours
- Testing and verification: 1 hour

---

## 8. Preventive Measures

1. **Database Migrations**: Implement proper migration system
2. **Environment Setup**: Standardize development environment
3. **Error Monitoring**: Add comprehensive error tracking
4. **Health Checks**: Implement systematic health monitoring
5. **Testing**: Add integration tests for critical endpoints
